simulacepen.py simulates the outcomes of a penalty shootout, given that each team A,B has a fixed probability p=p_A and q=p_B to score and there are at most sc penalties for each side. Also allows handicaping teams for playing second (pressure). 
Animates the aggregate outcome of the simulation with time and shows a comparison with the theoretical binomial distribution. 
guisim.py provides a simple Tkinter interface for simulacepen.py
